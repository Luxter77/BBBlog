### **‚ö†Ô∏è Phishing Alert! Game Developer Impersonation**

From the very start, there has been a surge in phishing attacks on Discord, the same as any other social and/or communications platform.

Scammers are posing as game developers, sending executable files that claim to be demos of their latest video games. These files are actually trojans and grabbers designed to steal your credentials and access tokens.

### **How the Scam Works** üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1. **Impersonation:** Scammers often create or use profiles that appear genuine. They may have many friends and belong to the same servers as you to appear convincing, usually thesea accounts are stolen from other people who already fell for the same or another scam or where stolen by a virus.

2. **Executable Files:** They send executable files (.exe) or links to blogs/sites containing these files, claiming to be game demos or other cool programs. These files contain malicious code and are in no way benign.

3. **Social Engineering:** Scammers may use persuasive language or desperation to manipulate you into opening the file or sharing your screen.
